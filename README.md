## üîß JavaScript Integration Example

```javascript
class MoodleCourseManager {
  constructor(baseUrl, token) {
    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
    this.token = token;
  }

  async createSection(courseIdNumber, title, externalId) {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('wstoken', this.token);
    formData.append('wsfunction', 'create_section');
    formData.append('moodlewsrestformat', 'json');
    formData.append('courseidnumber', courseIdNumber);
    formData.append('sectiontitle', title);
    formData.append('external_id', externalId);

    const response = await fetch(this.baseUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });
    
    return await response.json();
  }

  async addUrlResource(courseIdNumber, sectionExternalId, title, url, description, externalId) {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('wstoken', this.token);
    formData.append('wsfunction', 'add_url_resource');
    formData.append('moodlewsrestformat', 'json');
    formData.append('courseidnumber', courseIdNumber);
    formData.append('section_external_id', sectionExternalId);
    formData.append('resourcetitle', title);
    formData.append('resourceurl', url);
    formData.append('description', description);
    formData.append('external_id', externalId);

    const response = await fetch(this.baseUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData
    });
    
    return await response.json();
  }
}

// Usage
const manager = new MoodleCourseManager(
  'https://your-moodle-site.com/webservice/rest/server.php',
  'YOUR_TOKEN'
);

// Create section and add resource
const section = await manager.createSection(
  'COURSE123', 
  'Webinar Cardiology 2024', 
  'CARD_2024_001'
);

if (section.success) {
  const resource = await manager.addUrlResource(
    'COURSE123',
    'CARD_2024_001',
    'Cardiology Training Link',
    'https://your-webinar-platform.com/link',
    'Advanced cardiology training session',
    'URL_CARD_001'
  );
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The plugin provides detailed error messages for common issues:

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Course not found with idnumber: X` | Invalid course ID | Verify course exists and idnumber is correct |
| `External ID already exists for this course: X` | Duplicate external ID | Use unique external IDs within each course |
| `Section not found with external_id: X` | Invalid section external ID | Verify section was created successfully |
| `Invalid URL: "X". Must be a valid HTTPS URL.` | Malformed URL | Provide valid HTTPS URL |

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "exception": "invalid_parameter_exception",
  "errorcode": "invalidparameter",
  "message": "External ID already exists for this course: CARD_2024_001"
}
```

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### External ID Strategy

Use consistent naming patterns for external IDs:

**Sections:** `[SPECIALTY]_[YEAR]_[NUMBER]`
```
CARD_2024_001, PEDI_2024_002, SURG_2024_003
```

**Resources:** `URL_[SPECIALTY]_[TYPE]`
```
URL_CARD_MAIN, URL_CARD_MATERIALS, URL_CARD_QUIZ
```

### URL Management

- Use the default placeholder URL for initial creation
- Update URLs later through Moodle interface or external system
- The "- LINK DA MODIFICARE!!!" suffix helps identify placeholder links

### Error Prevention

- Always check if external IDs exist before creating
- Validate URLs before sending requests
- Handle API responses properly in your application
- Use unique external IDs across your system

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The plugin creates a mapping table for external ID management:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mdl_local_coursemanager_sections (
  id bigint(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  courseid bigint(10) NOT NULL,
  sectionid bigint(10) NOT NULL,
  external_id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  timecreated bigint(10) NOT NULL,
  timemodified bigint(10) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  UNIQUE KEY external_id_unique (courseid, external_id),
  UNIQUE KEY sectionid_unique (sectionid)
);
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Service Not Available
- Verify web services are enabled
- Check that "Course Manager Service" is active
- Ensure user has valid token for the service

### Permission Denied
- Verify user has required capabilities
- Check course enrollment and role assignments
- Confirm token is not expired

### Function Not Found
- Ensure plugin is properly installed
- Check plugin version compatibility
- Verify service functions are enabled

### Debug Mode
Enable Moodle debugging for detailed error information:
```
Site Administration > Development > Debugging
Set to "DEVELOPER: extra Moodle debug messages"
```

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
